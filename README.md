# Cineo_6CH_Driver
Cineo 6-Channel DC-DC Driver with both DMX and I2C Capability

Enclosed are all the projects for the Cineo 6-Channel Driver
1) PSoC Creator Project, source code (plus PSoC Creator install for verision 4.1, please do not upgrade!)
2) Eagle Board and Schematic Files
3) Gerber files for the Rev. A release
4) HEX files for production, PSoC Programmer Instructions

There are also two other code projects for the I2C Test Utility
a) Cineo_cHUB_I2C_Tester
b) Cineo_TestGUI
These two pieces of software utilize the DMXcHUB as the I2C master, and connects a user GUI with 6 sliders to the driver for control of the 6 channels.

All of these have been verified.
